Delete record plan:
Possible cases: empty list, only 1 record in list, record to delete is first in list, record to delete is last in list, record to delete is last in list

Check if start is null
if start is null return -1
follower = null
cursor = start

else (not null)
while cursor.acct num != acctNum && cursor.next != null)
	follower = cursor
	cursor = cursor.next
	(when this completes, will have matching acct num in cursor and previous in follower OR at end of list)
if cursor.acctnum != acctNum return -1 (no record exists)
else
if follower is null:
	if cursor.next is null:
		start = null
		deallocate cursor
		return 1
	else if cursor.next != null:
		start = cursor.next
		deallocate cursor
		return 1
if follower != null:

	if cursor.next is null:
		follower.next = null
		deallocate cursor
		return 1
	if cursor.next != null:
		follower.next = cursor.next
		deallocate cursor
		return 1



Add record plan: DON'T HAVE TO FINISH THIS NOW
Possible cases: empty list, only 1 record in list, record to add is first in list, record to add is last in list, record to add is in middle, duplicate record

if start = null:
	start = new record
else if start != null:
while cursor.acctnum < acctNum && cursor.next != null)
	follower = cursor
	cursor = cursor.next
if cursor.acctnum == acctNum return -1 (duplicate)
else

In summary the program performed mostly as expected. Records could be added in the correct order and persisted between uses. The program also made a file called data.txt to record the contents of the database when it was closed. It was of course not possible to test for memory leak given the circumstances. All functions did perform as intended.
There were several smaller problems which were corrected during the course of testing. Several functions that should have shown success or failure messages did not, so the source code had to be modified to include those. There was also a problem when populating the database from a text file where the debug message would show that the database tried to add the final record twice with the second instance of that record using a mailing address with several non-ASCII characters. The bugged record was never actually added and did not cause unintended behavior. This was found to be caused by an extra new line character being added by writeFile after the sentinel value to end an address string to the .txt file. It is now corrected.

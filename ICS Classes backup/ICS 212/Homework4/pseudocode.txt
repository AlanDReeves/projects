addRecord

*** Assume the following variables are already defined. ***

- start: The pointer to the first record of the list (or NULL)
- uaccountno: The user's account number (integer)
- uname: a character array containing the user's name
- uaddress: a character array containing the user's address
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
pseudocode:

define a pointer to record called newRecordP
define a pointer to a record called cursor
define a pointer to a record called priorNode
allocate a heap space and store its address in newRecordP

copy from uaccountno to accountno field in the record whose address is in newRecordP
copy from uname to name field in the record whose address is in newRecordP
copy from uaddress to the address field in the record whose address is in newRecordP

if (start is equal to Null)
	copy from newRecordP to start
	copy from the Null to the next field of the record whose address is in start

else
	if (the accountno of the record whose address is in newRecordP is less than the accountno of the record whose address is in start)
		copy from start to the next field in the record whose address is in newRecordP
		copy from newRecordP to start

	else
		copy from start to cursor
		while (the accountno field in the record whose address is in newRecordP is greater than the accountno field in the record whose address is in cursor AND the next field in the record whose address is in cursor is not equal to Null)
			copy from cursor to priorNode
			copy from the next field in the record whose address is in cursor to cursor

		if (the accountno field in the record whose address is in cursor is equal to the accountno field in the record whose address is in newRecordP)
			/*do nothing, duplicate*/

		else if (the next field in the record whose address is in cursor is equal to Null && the accountno field of the record whose address is in newRecordP is greater than the accountno field of the record whose address is in cursor)
			copy from newRecordP to the next field in the record whose address is in cursor.
			copy from Null to the next field in the record whose address is in newRecordP
		else 
			copy from cursor to the next field of the record whose address is in newRecordP
			copy from newRecordP to the next field of the record whose address is in priorNode

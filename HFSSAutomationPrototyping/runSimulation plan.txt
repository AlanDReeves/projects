Need to:
import pyaedt.hfss as H
import map and IRS design
    hfss = H.Hfss(project = projectname, design = designName, solution_type = ?, etc)

set IRS to correct x and Y
    Maybe add_3d_component_array_from_json()??
    change_design_settings(dictionary of settings)
    change_property()?

    hfss.modeler["modelName"].history().props["XSize"] = "5mm"
    hfss.modeler["modelName"].move([x, y, z])

    edit original move command to continue moving object
    took picture of screen


run simulation 
    hfss.analyze()
export results
    export_results(export_folder="?")

while ():
    move IRS
    repeat simulation


hfss.close_desktop()

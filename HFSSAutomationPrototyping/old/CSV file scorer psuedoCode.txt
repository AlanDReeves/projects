score x,y,capacity
while not EOF
    if num1 < x < num2 && num3 < y < num4:
        totalCapacity += capacity
        totalCount += 1
averageCap = totalCapacity / totalCount

score CumulativeProb vs ChannelCap
want line further to the right, more probability of higher capacities
    check y axis at several pre-determined points, record their place on x axis as the score. 
    This way having the graph to the right will be better.

    yAxis = 0.1
    points = 0
    while yAxis < 1.0 && not EOF
        cycle through coordinates until yCoord ~ yAxis
        points = xCoord
        yAxis += 0.1

    return points

score signal to noise ratio vs relative prob
want greater probability of higher SNR
    yAxis = 0.1
    points = 0
    while yAxis < 1.0 && not EOF
        cycle through coordinates until yCoord ~ yAxis
        points = xCoord
        yAxis += 0.1

package scores and file address into test class object, return that

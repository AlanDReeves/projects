Planning:

HFSSTESTING

Main method/API interacting class
	open input file, read testing parameters (x and y coordinates)
	while (coordinates left on input file)
	call runSimulation()
	call findAvgVal()
	place score, simulation parameters, and CSV file location into dictionary
	place dictionary in list of all results
	call resultsToFile()

runSimulation(): TODO
	takes x and y coordinates, possibly from optimization software
	runs test in HFSS through API
	exports CSV file

findAvgVal: done
	scores test with static method

evaluateWorkArea: TODO
	split work area into 3x3 grid
	evaluate avg value of each grid
	save each value seperately

resultsToPickle: done
	store list of dictionaries with pickle

resultsToCSV: done
	store list of dictionaries to CSV with one line per dictionary

getParams(): done
	gets x and y coordinates from csv file, adds them to list

userInterface(): TODO
	gets desired X and Y range to check signal strength within
	asks for name of parameters list CSV file
	asks for desired output file name

Something to view test output?

Future: TODO
	

_________________________________________________________________
HFSSTestingViewer (decided not to do this)
Do I want to write a text file or have a program that does all this?

displayResults()
	simply print contents of list as they currently are

sortByAvg()
	sort list by value of AVG

sortByFileName()
	sort list by file name

searchForFileName()
	show results containing a specific file name

searchByX()
	show results containing X parameter

searchByY()
	show results containing Y parameter

searchByXY()
	show results containing both X and Y parameter

userInterface()
	loops, allowing the user to choose from above options

_____________________________________________________________________

GUI:
must produce minX, maxX, minY, maxY, input file name, desired output file name

TODO:
Finish making the HFSS API function

Include update information showing that program is running
